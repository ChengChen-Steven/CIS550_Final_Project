### CIS 550 Project Proposal 

1.Motivation for the idea/description of the problem the application solves

*Nowadays we have seen plenty of stock trading apps and stock information sites in the market but they are getting more and more complex and heavyweight as we use them. We are trying to build a simple but useful site for people to look up and track the stock performance of the companies of their choice. We will have a clean and easy-to-read dashboard for people to customize their own portfolio/watchlist and obtain useful information for the stocks on the website.

2. List of features you will definitely implement in the application

*Feature #1: An overview of SP500 Market Performance Filtered by Industry
*Feature #2: A dynamic table for people to add/remove companies they follow in Watchlist/Portfolio
*Feature #3: A side-to-side comparison for people to view a key metrics comparison between two stocks
*Feature #4: A detailed page includes specific information for any specific stock in SP500

3. List of features you might implement in the application, given enough time

*A recommendation engine that provides recommendation to users for similar stocks and popular companies
